The purpose of a work being to live and survive, for oneself and for others, a free software is not thus synonymous of gratuitous, unless it is a public service funded by taxes.<\/p>\n<p>Donations are a source of income for free software designers. Just like we are free to use these programs, we are also free to define what we give according to our means. Sometimes the authors don't ask for money for various reasons.<\/p>\n<p>But the shareware donation system, outside the case of amateurism regarding few currency units, except for humanitarian work not controlled by the State, is a false and problematical litigious solution for a false cash flow problem, and from a fiscal point of view it would be more accurate to consider the libre purchasing as commercial sales when the product is an intangible deliverable, which requires to not flat rate taxing the existence of an entity and only the generated flow of money.<\/p>\n<p>Developing free or open source software is a vision about source code, sharing of knowledge and evolution of computing.
